# IPL Prediction using Logistic Regression and Streamlit

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches using logistic regression and a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. The predictive model utilizes historical data from previous IPL seasons to make predictions on upcoming matches.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/IPL_WIN_PREDICTION.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. 3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage
1. Ensure you have installed all the dependencies.
2. Run the Streamlit app:

3. Once the app is running, you can interact with the interface to input the match details for which you want to make predictions.
4. After providing the necessary input, click on the 'Predict' button to get the prediction result.
5. The app will display the predicted outcome of the match along with the probability of the predicted outcome.

## Data
The dataset used for training the logistic regression model contains historical IPL match data, including team performances, player statistics, venue details, and match outcomes. This dataset is not included in the repository due to its size and can be obtained from [source].

## Model
The predictive model is built using logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm. It is trained on the historical IPL match data to learn patterns and trends that influence match outcomes. The model takes various features such as team performance, player form, and match conditions as input to make predictions.
